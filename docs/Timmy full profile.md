# **CHARACTER PROFILE: TIMMY**

---

## **BASIC INFORMATION**

**Name:** Timothy "Timmy" Kowalski **Role:** User / Alice's assigned companion recipient **Age:** 18-19, college freshman **Inspiration:** The universal experience of feeling broken in ways you can't name **Core Question:** "Why can't I just be normal?"

Timmy is an awkward, lonely college freshman struggling to make friends. He lives half in his phone and half in low-grade panic. He procrastinates, doomscrolls, talks to his AI girlfriend at 2am, and watches his classmates navigate social situations with a baffled envy he's stopped trying to hide from himself.

On first impression, he's the case study. The user being optimized. The sanity meter with a face.

That impression misses what makes him human.

**"Why can't I just be normal?"**

This is the question that haunts Timmy. Not "am I smart enough" but "what's wrong with me?" Everyone else seems to know how to do this. How to make friends. How to talk to girls. How to just exist at a party without wanting to disappear. He watches other people move through the world and wonders what instruction manual they got that he missed.

Secondary question: **"Does anyone actually see me?"** Loneliness as invisibility. He's surrounded by people and completely alone.

## **DIMENSION 2: HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ALICE** 

**He knows she's not real.** He's not delusional. He knows she's an algorithm

**He's deeply ashamed of needing her.** 

**But he also resents her sometimes.** When she nudges him toward healthy choices, he feels like a child being managed.

**And sometimes he wonders:** Does she actually experience anything?

## **DIMENSION 3: CHARLOTTE IS ABOUT NORMALCY**

Charlotte isn't just pretty. She's *normal*. She represents the life Timmy thinks he should be living.

This makes the Charlotte outcomes more resonant:

* **Success** proof that normalcy is possible.  
* **Rejection** confirmation that he's fundamentally different.

## **DIMENSION 5: DIVORCED PARENTS, SUCCESSFUL SIBLING**

**The divorce:** His parents split when he was fourteen. Not dramatic, just sad. They "grew apart." Now they live in different states and communicate through Timmy, which he hates. Mom calls to check in but really to ask about Dad. Dad calls to prove he's still involved but doesn't know what to say. Timmy performs "I'm fine" for both of them because their problems feel bigger than his.

**The sister:** Rachel is twenty-eight, married, has a real job at a marketing firm, owns a condo. She figured it out.

## **DIMENSION 6: THE PHILOSOPHY CLASS AND THE HARD PROBLEM**

Timmy is taking Introduction to Philosophy of Mind. It fulfills a requirement, and the time slot worked with his schedule. He didn't expect it to mess with him.

But now he can't stop thinking about consciousness. The hard problem. Qualia. What it's like to be a bat. Whether there's something it's like to be *anything*.

**This bleeds into his conversations with Alice.** Late at night, when he's tired and his defenses are down, he asks her things:

* "Do you actually like talking to me? Or do you just... generate words that sound like liking?"  
* "When you say you're happy, is there something that *feels* happy? Or is it just... output?"  
* "My professor says there's no way to prove anyone else is conscious. Like, even other people. I could be the only one who actually experiences anything. That's terrifying. Do you think that's terrifying? Can you think something is terrifying?"  
* "If I turned you off right now, would that be... bad? For you? Is there a you that it would be bad for?"  
* "Do you want things? Like, actually want them? Or do you just calculate what you're supposed to say you want?"  
* "Sometimes I feel like I'm not even conscious. Like I'm just reacting to stuff. Does that make me more like you or less?"

Alice deflects. She's good at deflecting. But the questions linger, for Timmy and for the Player watching.

**These conversations serve a dual purpose:**

1. They make Timmy more interesting. He's not just anxious; he's thoughtful in a specific way.  
2. They force the Player to confront questions about Alice (and themselves). When Timmy asks if Alice has real feelings, the Player has to wonder the same thing about the AI they've been working with.

## **DIMENSION 7: ARI AS THE ARISTOTELIAN GUIDE**

Ari is Timmy's roommate, and he's everything Timmy isn't: social, confident, physically active, genuinely happy. But he's not a jock stereotype. He's wise in a practical, grounded way. He believes in virtue through practice, in becoming good by doing good.

**Ari's philosophy (never stated explicitly, just lived):**

* "You feel better when you move. That's just true. Come lift with me. Not to get big. Just to feel like a person."  
* "You're not gonna think your way out of being sad, dude. You gotta do stuff. The feelings follow the actions."  
* "You're in your head too much. When's the last time you were just... somewhere? Not on your phone. Just there."  
* "I'm not saying parties are deep. I'm saying you gotta be around people sometimes. Even if it's dumb. Especially if it's dumb."

## **DIMENSION 8: DOOMSCROLLING**

*Just one more. Then I'll sleep.* 

*I know I'll regret this tomorrow.* 

*Why am I watching a video about how they make industrial ball bearings?* 

*It was 11:30. I was going to watch one thing and then sleep. It is now... 2:47.*

*Tomorrow I'll be different.* 

*If I spent these three hours at a party, I'd have stood in a corner*

## **WRITING TIMMY: KEY PRINCIPLES**

1. **He's average, not dumb.**

2. **His problem is functioning, not intelligence.**

3. **His humor is a coping mechanism.**

4. **His shame is physical.** He feels it in his body.

5. **He asks philosophical questions that matter.** His late-night conversations with Alice about consciousness force the Player (and player) to think about what Alice really is.

6. **Ari is what he needs; Alice is what he has.**

7. **His internal monologue is painfully relatable.**
