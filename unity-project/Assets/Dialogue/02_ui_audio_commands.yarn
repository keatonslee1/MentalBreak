// This file previously contained audio and background key documentation.
// That information is now maintained elsewhere:
//
// AUDIO: See docs/audio_guide.md for FMOD music commands and legacy audio.
//
// BACKGROUNDS: Background keys match filenames (without extension)
// in Assets/Resources/Graphics/Backgrounds. The system auto-discovers
// available backgrounds from that folder.
