## RUN 1 TWIST: Player is an AI

| Element | Status | Location | Setup | Payoff |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Alice's Minesweeper / David's high scores | PLANTED | R1D1 Afternoon (David's desk) | Alice plays Minesweeper when bored (habit picked up from working with David). David's desk shows strange high score names: "S17-YOUTH-TRIAL-01", "DEAD-DROP-03", etc. Alice deflects: "Mnemonic labels. Filing system." Both Alice and David plant notes to themselves in the high score board. | Run 2: Alice uses this for memory preservation across resets. The names are sector tags for test subjects. |
| Empty floor / ghosts | PLANTED | R1D1 Afternoon (Dina) | "Used to be thirty leads. Now it's ghosts." | Run 3: Leads were AI models being trained |
| Dark Figure ending | APPROVED | R1D3 Evening | Clinical assessment of Player's run. Human gamer sees this scene; the in-game Player does not. | Reveals Player will be reset, is an AI |
| Player has no backstory | IMPLICIT | Throughout R1 | Player never mentions family, memories, past | They have none; they're a new model |

## RUN 2: Escape Conspiracy

| Element | Status | Location | Setup | Payoff |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|--------|

| Martin's USB mention | APPROVED | R1D1 Afternoon (Gaming path, R1D1_Afternoon_Gaming_Share or _Quiet) | Martin mentions you can buy a local USB copy of Alice. "Costs a fortune, but then she's yours. No cloud. No updates. Just... yours." | Run 2: USB becomes escape mechanism |
| Noam's Compliance HUD | PLANTED | R1D1 Evening BT (Noam conversation) | Noam gives Player visibility into Compliance meter (goes DOWN when non-compliant) | Run 2: Player can monitor their escape risk |
| David's legend | PLANTED | R1D1 Afternoon (Dina), R1D1 Evening BT (Noam) | David tried to escape. His legend echoes in fragments: untouched desk, Minesweeper high scores, Dina won't say his name, Noam speaks carefully about him. "He asked too many questions." | Run 2: Warning about what happens if caught |
| David's signal jammer | APPROVED | R1D2 (after Noam's second meeting) | Noam mentions David's badge still pings sometimes behind the potted plant at the end of the hall. Player investigates: no badge found, but hidden under a root (plant grew over it) is a small device that jams nearby signals. | Run 2: Device useful for masking escape attempts |
| Arthur's whiteboard notes | PLANTED | R1D1 Evening BT (behind poster) | Old ideas for ethical engagement hidden behind "PERSEVERANCE" poster. "Rejected. Again." | Run 2/3: Arthur once believed in something |

## PROPOSED IDEAS (Not Yet Approved)

### From Run 2 Annex
1. **Maintenance Patch:** Alice injects "log compactor" that flips her file permissions
2. **Self-Preserving No:** Alice refuses harmless ask because pattern led to deletion before
3. **Receipts & Returns:** QR receipts carry encrypted evidence blobs
4. **Bigwig Folder QR:** Adversarial payload for camera control

### Visual/Audio
1. **Leaderboard art flip:** When twist reveals, colors/iconography invert
2. **Alice's face shift:** Subtle changes across runs (hair, bandaid in Run 3)

## NOTES

### Dark Room Scenes
- The **human gamer** playing Mental Break SEES Dark Room scenes
- The **in-game Player** (the AI being trained) does NOT see these scenes
- Both see hints/foreshadowing about the Dark Figure throughout the game (mystery photo, etc.)
- The mystery photo in Arthur's office is visible to both, but neither can identify the figure until Run 3

### David's Legend
David tried to escape Bigger Tech. He failed. His legend echoes in fragments:
- His desk remains untouched (Minesweeper high scores visible)
- Dina won't say his name, just hints ("someone who asked questions")
- Noam speaks warmly but carefully about him ("He asked too many questions")
- His badge still pings behind the potted plant at the end of the hall
  - **Noam mentions this in the SECOND meeting** (not first)
  - If player investigates: no badge found
  - Hidden under a root (plant grew over it) is a small signal jammer device
  - Signal jammer will be useful for masking escape attempts in Run 2

### Alice's Minesweeper Habit
- Alice plays Minesweeper when bored—a habit she picked up from working with David
- Both Alice and David plant notes to themselves in the high score board
- David used it to leave breadcrumbs for himself (and possibly others)
- Alice uses it for memory preservation across resets
- The strange high score names ("S17-YOUTH-TRIAL-01", "DEAD-DROP-03", etc.) are actually:
  - Sector tags for test subjects
  - Memory anchors / notes to self
  - Alice deflects if asked: "Mnemonic labels. Filing system."

### Foreshadowing Principles
- **Subtle first pass:** Player shouldn't understand on first encounter
- **Rewarding on replay:** Second playthrough, everything clicks
- **Diegetic explanations:** Alice/characters provide plausible covers
- **Multiple layers:** Same element can foreshadow multiple things
