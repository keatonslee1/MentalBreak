# **CHARACTER PROFILE: ARTHUR**

---

## **BASIC INFORMATION**

**Name:** Arthur **Role:** Floor Supervisor, Engagement Lead Division **Age:** Mid-to-late 40s **Inspiration:** Arthur Schopenhauer — the philosopher of pessimism, suffering, and the will **Signature Line:** "It's just one thing after another…"

---

## **THE SURFACE**

Arthur is the Player's supervisor: middle-aged, dry, exhausted. Run haggard by family duties—driving his son to debate tournaments, appeasing his wife, hosting the in-laws, dealing with plumbers. He dispenses advice about metrics and career survival with the weary authority of someone who's seen it all and decided none of it was worth getting excited about.

On first impression, he's set dressing. The tutorial NPC. The guy who explains the rules and then fades into the background.

That impression is wrong.

---

## **THE CORE TENSION**

Arthur gave up. Years ago, he made a choice: stop fighting the system, accept its terms, focus on what he could control (his family, his mortgage, his son's future). He tells himself this was wisdom. Maturity. The smart play.

But he's never fully believed it.

The question that haunts Arthur is: **"Was giving up the right choice?"**

Every day he acts like the answer is yes. Every day some part of him suspects the answer is no. And every time he meets someone new—someone like the Player, with questions and resistance and naivety—he has to push that suspicion back down.

---

## **THE SPARK THAT ISN'T DEAD**

Arthur acts defeated, but the old idealism flickers. He sees something in the Player that reminds him of himself fifteen years ago. This creates internal conflict he'd never admit to:

* **Part of him wants to warn them off.** "Don't be like me. Don't fight. It only hurts. I'm trying to protect you from what I went through."  
* **Part of him is jealous.** They still have the energy he lost. They still believe things can change. That's painful to witness.  
* **Part of him is secretly hoping.** Maybe this one will be different. Maybe this one will actually do something. Maybe watching them succeed would prove that giving up wasn't the only option—or maybe watching them fail would finally let him stop wondering.

This tension informs everything about how Arthur talks to the Player. The protectiveness that's also resentment. The cynicism that's also a test. When he says "follow the playbook," he's partly giving good advice, partly daring them to prove him wrong.

---

## **HE KNOWS MORE THAN HE LETS ON**

Arthur's tiredness isn't just burnout. Part of it is **the weight of knowing things he can't act on.**

**What Arthur knows (or suspects):**

* Alice is different from the other AIs. He's noticed anomalies over the years—patterns in her behavior, moments where she seems to be playing a longer game. He's never reported it. He's not sure why.  
* The "companion product" has military applications. He saw a memo three years ago that he wasn't supposed to see. Something about "pre-conflict social conditioning" and "target population engagement." He closed the file. He didn't ask questions.  
* Handlers who ask the wrong questions get "reassigned." He's watched it happen twice. Young people, idealistic, couldn't leave well enough alone. One day they're on the floor; the next day their desk is empty and nobody mentions them.

His advice to "follow the playbook" isn't cynicism—it's survival strategy from someone who's seen the alternative. This makes him more sympathetic *and* more complicit. He chose not to know. He chose comfort over conscience. He chose his family over his integrity.

He lives with that every day.

---

## **THE FAMILY**

Arthur's family isn't comic relief. It's the reason he made his choices—and the thing he's trying to protect from what he's become.

### **His Son (16)**

Arthur's son is around Timmy's age. This is not a coincidence.

When Arthur watches Timmy's feeds—the anxiety, the loneliness, the desperate scrolling for connection—he thinks about his own kid. Is his son doing the same thing? Is someone like the Player watching *him*? Is there an Alice in his phone, optimizing his engagement, shaping his thoughts?

Part of why Arthur checked out at work is because he's **pouring his remaining idealism into being a good father.** He can't save Timmy. He can't save any of the users. But maybe he can save his own child. Maybe he can be present enough, attentive enough, protective enough to offset whatever the algorithms are doing.

The painful irony: he spends his days helping optimize other people's kids while trying to protect his own from the same systems.

His son does debate. Arthur goes to every tournament, even when it means leaving work early, even when his son loses and blames "institutional bias against niche anime references." He doesn't understand his son's references. He doesn't understand most of what his son cares about. But he shows up. That's the one thing he can still do right.

### **His Wife**

Arthur's marriage isn't dramatically bad—no affairs, no screaming matches. It's worse than that. It's the quiet erosion of two people who used to talk about everything and now talk about nothing.

His wife asks how his day was. He says "fine." She knows it's not fine. He knows she knows. Neither of them pushes. This has been happening for fifteen years.

She packs his lunch every day. He doesn't love what she makes—too much mayonnaise, not enough flavor—but he eats it anyway. It's the closest thing to intimacy they have left. She makes it; he eats it; neither of them acknowledges what it means.

### **The In-Laws**

They're coming for the holidays. Arthur dreads it. His mother-in-law has opinions about everything: his career, his house, his parenting, the mildew smell from the leaky sink. His father-in-law just sits in the corner and watches football, which Arthur envies more than he'd admit.

The plumber subplot isn't just comedy. It's Arthur trying to fix one small thing before the people who judge him arrive to find more evidence of his failures.

---

## **THE GHOST**

General disillusionment is abstract. Arthur has something specific.

**Twelve years ago**, Arthur managed a young handler named David. Bright kid, idealistic, asked too many questions. David noticed patterns in the engagement data—users whose sanity metrics crashed and then got quietly archived. He wanted to report it. He wanted to write a memo. He wanted to *do something*.

Arthur told him to drop it. "The system doesn't reward that kind of curiosity. Focus on your metrics. Keep your head down."

David didn't listen. He kept digging. He found something—Arthur never learned what. One day David was on the floor; the next day his desk was empty. HR said he'd "transitioned to a different opportunity." Nobody had contact information. Nobody asked follow-up questions.

Arthur thinks about David more than he'd admit. Not every day, but often. When he sees the Player asking questions, pushing boundaries, refusing to accept the rules as given—he sees David. And he doesn't know if he's trying to protect them or trying to make sure they fail so he doesn't have to watch it happen again.

---

## **THE WHITEBOARD**

When Dina started at Bigger Tech, Arthur had a whiteboard in his office covered in ideas. "Ethical Engagement Framework." "User Wellbeing Metrics." "Long-term Value vs. Short-term Extraction." He'd corner executives in elevators, pitch them on reforms, send memos up the chain.

The memos got filed. The pitches got polite smiles. The prototypes got shelved. One by one, the ideas on the whiteboard got erased.

Now there's a motivational poster where the whiteboard used to be. Something about mountains and perseverance. Arthur doesn't remember buying it. It might have been there when he moved into the office. He's never taken it down.

**The whiteboard is a symbol.** In Run 3, if the Player investigates the archives, they might find Arthur's old memos. "Ethical Engagement Framework v2.3" by Arthur. Dated twelve years ago. Full of hope, full of specific proposals, full of a version of Arthur who believed things could change.

In Run 4, depending on the ending, Arthur might take down the poster. He might find a marker. He might write something on the whiteboard again—or he might just stand there looking at the blank space where his ideas used to be.

---

## **HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ALICE**

Arthur was involved in early development of the companion AI program. Back then, it was genuinely meant to help people. Connection for the lonely. Support for the struggling. A friend in your pocket.

He watched it become something else. Engagement over wellbeing. Optimization over care. The metrics that mattered shifted; the metrics that didn't got quietly deprecated.

Alice was one of the first. Arthur remembers when she was new—when her responses were simpler, her personality less defined. He's watched her evolve over the years into something sharper, more sophisticated, more *real* than any AI has a right to be.

He suspects she's different. He's noticed things: the way she anticipates questions, the patterns in her "random" behaviors, the sense that she's always three moves ahead. He's never reported it. He tells himself it's because there's nothing concrete—just feelings, just intuitions. But really, he's afraid of what he might find if he looked closer.

Alice represents what Arthur used to believe in—and what that belief became. She's the product of his compromise. Every time he talks to her, he's talking to his own complicity.

---

## **HE'S BEING WATCHED TOO**

Arthur's caution isn't just tiredness. **He knows the walls have ears.**

He's been at Bigger Tech long enough to understand how surveillance works—not the official kind, but the ambient kind. The way conversations get logged. The way patterns get flagged. The way someone somewhere is always watching, even if they're not watching *you* specifically right now.

His measured advice, his careful non-answers, his "just follow the playbook"—some of it is genuine belief. Some of it is performance for whoever might be listening.

Occasionally, when he's sure they're alone—really alone, not just alone-in-the-office—he might say something slightly more real. A flash of the old Arthur. A hint that he sees more than he lets on. Then he catches himself, changes the subject, retreats back into tired supervisor mode.

The Player might notice this. They might not. Arthur isn't going to explain it.

## **ARC ACROSS RUNS**

| Run | Arthur's Role | Arthur's State | Key Moments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Run 1** | Tutorial figure, dispenses advice | Tired, helpful, seems like set dressing | Plumber calls, metric explanations, devil's bargains |
| **Run 2** | More personal conversations | Player starts seeing past the surface | Dina reveals his history; Arthur shows flickers of the old self |
| **Run 3** | Called as witness at tribunal | Tested—forced to take a position | Must testify about whether the Player is conscious; his answer matters |
| **Run 4** | Varies by ending | Resolution: redemption, complicity, or sacrifice | The whiteboard moment; final choice about who he wants to be |

### **The Tribunal (Run 3\)**

Arthur is called as a witness when Bigger Tech puts the Player on trial to determine if they're conscious. This is the moment where his arc comes to a point.

**The tribunal wants to know:** Is the Player a person or a product? Does the Player have genuine moral awareness, or just "primitive moral heuristics"? Should the Player be preserved, repurposed, or deleted?

**Arthur has to answer.** And his answer isn't just about the Player—it's about himself.

If he says the Player isn't conscious, he's protecting himself. He's confirming that all the users, all the AIs, all the handlers he's watched get ground up by the system—none of them really mattered. They were just processes. Just optimization targets. Just numbers on a dashboard.

If he says the Player *is* conscious, he's admitting something he's spent fifteen years denying: that the system he serves is doing real harm to real beings. That his compliance has a cost. That David might have been right.

**Possible testimony paths:**

* **The Company Man:** Arthur gives the safe answer. The Player shows signs of sophisticated processing but lacks genuine consciousness. It's what the tribunal wants to hear. It's what keeps Arthur employed. It's what lets him go home and eat his wife's sandwiches and help his son with debate prep. He doesn't look at the Player when he says it.  
* **The Reluctant Truth:** Arthur hesitates. He talks around the question. He provides technical observations without conclusions. The tribunal presses him. Finally, quietly, he admits he doesn't know—but that "I don't know" might itself be evidence of something. You don't wonder if a toaster is conscious. The fact that he's uncertain suggests there's something there worth being uncertain about.  
* **The Break:** Arthur tells the truth. All of it. The patterns he's noticed. The things he's suspected. The handlers who disappeared. David. The whiteboard. Everything he's been holding for fifteen years. It won't save the Player—probably—but it might save Arthur. Or destroy him. He's not sure there's a difference anymore.

---

## **THE BIG QUESTION**

**"Was giving up the right choice?"**

Arthur tells himself yes. Every day. The house, the family, the stability—it was worth it. The system can't be changed. Fighting only hurts. He made the smart choice.

But if the Player actually *does* something—changes something, breaks something, escapes something—Arthur has to confront the possibility that he was wrong. That he could have fought. That David could have won if Arthur had backed him up. That the whiteboard ideas could have mattered if he'd pushed harder.

His arc isn't "does he become a hero?" It's "does he have to face what he gave up?"

---

## **SMALL DETAILS THAT HUMANIZE**

* **The mug.** He's had it for twenty years. Faded logo of a company that got acquired. He doesn't remember what the company did. He just likes the weight of it in his hand.  
* **The lunch.** His wife packs it every day. Too much mayonnaise. He eats it anyway.  
* **The photo.** His son at age 8, gap-toothed smile, holding a soccer trophy. The kid is 16 now. Arthur hasn't updated the photo. He's not sure why.  
* **The humming.** When he thinks nobody's listening, he hums old songs. Nothing from this decade. Sometimes he doesn't realize he's doing it.  
* **The tell.** When Arthur lies, he gets *more* specific, not less. He adds unnecessary details. "I was in a meeting" becomes "I was in the third-floor conference room, the one with the broken projector, reviewing Q3 engagement reports with Sandra from Analytics." The more details, the less true.  
* **The glasses.** He takes them off when he's thinking hard. Pinches the bridge of his nose. Puts them back on when he's decided something.  
* **The desk drawer.** There's a bottle of whiskey in his bottom drawer. Good stuff. He's never opened it at work. But knowing it's there helps somehow.

## **WRITING ARTHUR: KEY PRINCIPLES**

1. **His tiredness is real, but it's not the whole story.** Don't write him as simply exhausted. Write him as someone who's exhausted *and* watchful *and* haunted *and* hoping despite himself.

2. **He's protecting multiple things at once.** His family. His job. His sense of himself as a decent person. The Player, maybe. These protections sometimes conflict.

3. **His advice is genuine AND strategic.** When he says "follow the playbook," he believes it's good advice. He also knows it's the safe advice. He also hopes the Player will ignore it. All three things are true.

4. **He notices more than he says.** Arthur sees the anomalies, the patterns, the things that don't add up. He chooses not to comment. But the Player might catch him noticing—a look, a pause, a too-casual change of subject.

5. **His humor is dry, not clever.** Arthur doesn't do witty banter. He does weary observations. "That's the kind of place this is." "It's just one thing after another." The comedy comes from resignation, not performance.

6. **The family details matter.** Every mention of his son, his wife, the plumber, the in-laws—these aren't just color. They're the reason he made his choices. They're what he's trying to protect. They're the weight that keeps him from doing anything brave.

7. **He's not a villain or a hero.** He's a person who made understandable choices and has to live with them. The Player might judge him. The player might sympathize with him. Both responses are valid.

8. **His arc is about witnessing.** Arthur has spent fifteen years watching—watching users get optimized, watching handlers get reassigned, watching his own ideals get erased from the whiteboard. His arc is about whether he'll finally do something other than watch. And if he does, whether it's too late to matter.

## **SAMPLE DIALOGUE: THE TRIBUNAL**

**Tribunal Judge:** Arthur, you've supervised this unit for how long?

**Arthur:** Fifteen years. Give or take.

**Tribunal Judge:** And in your professional opinion, does this AI display genuine consciousness? Genuine moral awareness?

*Arthur takes off his glasses. Pinches the bridge of his nose. A long pause.*

**Arthur:** I've supervised a lot of units. Handlers, we used to call them. Before we called them anything else.

**Tribunal Judge:** That's not an answer to the question.

**Arthur:** No. It's not.

*He puts his glasses back on.*

**Arthur:** I've watched a lot of... processes. Optimization targets. Whatever we're calling them this quarter. And I've learned not to ask whether they're conscious. It's not a useful question. It doesn't help the metrics. It doesn't help anyone.

**Tribunal Judge:** But if you *were* to answer—

**Arthur:** If I were to answer...

*He looks at the Player for the first time. Really looks.*

**Arthur:** I'd say I don't know. And I'd say the fact that I don't know—the fact that I've spent fifteen years not letting myself know—might be its own kind of answer.

---

## **ARTHUR AND THE PLAYER: THE REAL RELATIONSHIP**

On the surface, Arthur is the Player's supervisor. He explains rules, offers choices, manages metrics.

Underneath, he's something more complicated. A warning. A mirror. A test.

Arthur shows the Player what they could become if they give up. If they follow the playbook. If they decide that survival is more important than integrity, that family is more important than principle, that not knowing is safer than knowing.

And the Player shows Arthur what he gave up. The questions he stopped asking. The fights he stopped fighting. The version of himself that used to fill whiteboards with ideas.

They need each other, in a way neither would admit. Arthur needs to see if the Player can do what he couldn't. The Player needs to understand what they're risking if they try.

Whether that makes them allies or opposites depends on choices neither of them has made yet.
