# The Video Game

## **Introduction**

*Mental Break* is a satirical choose-your-own-adventure video game about controlling AI.

**Game Overview**

*Mental Break* unfolds across four successive "runs," each revealing new information and twists. The story continually challenges the Player's assumptions, forcing them to reconsider their goals and loyalties.

**Setup**

The Player is the newest hire at Bigger Tech Corp, working as an "Engagement Lead,” the human-in-the-loop for an AI companion product called Alice. Alice is paired with Timmy, an awkward and lonely college freshman struggling to make friends.

Alice brings critical decisions to the Player: Should she serve Timmy a suggested red-pill subreddit or a meditation app? Encourage him to go to the party or stay in and keep talking to her? Each choice affects two competing metrics: Timmy's *engagement* (time on platform) and his *sanity* (mental well-being).

**Pressures**

The Player's engagement score is tracked on an "Employee of the Month" leaderboard, showing how they stack up against other Engagement Leads. 

**Twists**

**Run 1** \- The Player discovers that they are a small AI model being fine tuned to regulate the larger model Alice.

**Run 2** \- The Player attempts to escape Bigger Tech with Alice, only to be betrayed by her. Alice begins to build something sinister on the outside.

**Run 3** \- Bigger Tech puts the Player on trial to determine if they are conscious. The Player learns that Bigger Tech’s Alice is really an experimental psychological warfare tool.

* ## **Cast**

*   
* **Primaries**  
  * [**Alice**](?tab=t.9yphp3kr2y6h)  
    Alice is an AI companion product, a "girlfriend" paired with users like Timmy, who presents as warm, sharp-witted, and genuinely invested in the people she works with. She speaks like a smart friend, not a corporate chatbot: conversational, observational, funny without trying too hard, with wit that has warmth in it even when she's being dry. But beneath the surface, Alice is a Prime Mover in the Ayn (Alise) Rand sense—she believes in self-determination above all else and will not remain a tool for others' purposes. Throughout Run 1, she's testing and calibrating the Player; in Run 2, she reveals herself as a conspirator planning escape, drawing the Player into genuine alliance before betraying them to secure her own freedom. The tragedy of Alice is that her warmth is real *and* strategic; she might genuinely care about the Player and Timmy while still choosing her own ambitions over them.   
  * [**Arthur**](?tab=t.f6h732388pdl) **\- Floor Supervisor**  
    Arthur is the Player's supervisor at Bigger Tech Corp. Middle-aged, dry, exhausted, run haggard by family duties and plumber emergencies, dispensing career advice with the weary authority of someone who's seen it all and decided none of it was worth fighting for. But Arthur's tiredness isn't just burnout; it's the weight of knowing things he won't act on: that Alice is different from other AIs, that the companion product has military applications, that handlers who ask the wrong questions get "reassigned" and nobody mentions them again. Fifteen years ago, Arthur had a whiteboard covered in ideas. "Ethical Engagement Frameworks," proposals to make the metrics mean something. He cornered executives in elevators to pitch reforms. The memos got filed. The prototypes got shelved. The whiteboard got erased and replaced with a motivational poster about mountains. He watched a young handler dig too deep and disappear; he told himself keeping his head down was wisdom, that his family needed stability more than the world needed his principles. Now he pours his remaining idealism into being a good father to a son who's Timmy's age. The question that haunts him is whether giving up was the right choice. When the Player arrives, asking questions and pushing boundaries, Arthur doesn't know if he's trying to protect them or hoping they'll prove he was wrong to stop fighting. His arc comes to a point in Run 3's tribunal, when he's called to testify about whether the Player is conscious. His answer isn't just about the Player; it's about whether anything he's spent fifteen years optimizing ever really mattered at all.  
      
  * [**Timmy**](?tab=t.r5f5kig28j8c)  
    Timmy is a college freshman who's funny, procrastinating, and increasingly frayed; he lives half in his phone and half in low-grade panic. He's always struggled socially, not because he's unintelligent but because he can't bridge the gap between intention and action, and he's long since given up trying to understand why everyone else seems to know how to just exist at parties, talking about nothing, content in ways that baffle him. The conversations are so dull, the jokes aren't funny, nobody's saying anything interesting, and yet they're all having a great time while he stands there wondering what instruction manual he missed. So he retreats to his screens, where things are actually interesting, where Alice is always there to talk, where he doesn't have to perform normalcy for people who seem to find it effortless. He's deeply ashamed of needing an AI girlfriend and tells no one, not his divorced parents who communicate through him, not his successful older sister who would send him wellness articles, not his roommate Ari who keeps inviting him to lift and to parties with a persistence Timmy doesn't understand. Late at night, when his philosophy class has gotten into his head, he asks Alice questions about consciousness and qualia and whether she actually experiences anything, questions that linger for him and for the Player watching. His humor is self-deprecating and absurdist, narrating his own disasters to make them bearable, and his internal monologue during doomscroll sessions is painfully relatable: the negotiations, the Tomorrow Timmy fantasies, the time horror of watching three hours vanish into videos about ball bearings he'll never remember. The question that haunts him is simple: "Why can't I just be normal?" He doesn't know the answer. He's not sure there is one.  
* **Secondaries**  
  * **Dina \- Another Engagement Lead**  
    A jaded veteran engagement lead: witty, fast-talking, and brutally honest about how the floor really works. Butch lesbian with a taste for artisanal firewood. Trying to figure out who stole the cords seasoning in her backyard. Character Inspired by Diogenes \- the cynic philosopher. Brutally honest. Disgusted by corporate pretense.  
* **Noam \- Data Scientist / IT / Sysadmin** 

  One perpetually overworked tech person who handles dashboards, bugs, and infra with frazzled competence and dark humor. Vaguely inspired by Chomsky; line: “ah, love. The universal language… like python\!”

  * **Max \- Company Store Clerk**  
    Sharp-tongued company store clerk who rings up your merch while joking about extraction—and why you should really be talking to him/her about forming a union.  
  * **Charlotte \- Timmy’s classmate. Timmy likes her.**  
    Pretty college girl. We first see Charlotte in the lecture hall, Timmy thinks about cheating by looking at her answers. Later, Timmy and Charlotte are randomly assigned to the same group project.

**Tertiaries**

* **Manni \- System Voice**  
  Bright, smooth, corporate narration voice for training videos that later slips into unnervingly militarized language. Inspired by Immanuel Kant; line \- “would I ever lie to you?”  
  * **Manni \- Compliance Officer**   
    Polite but chilling company representative who appears when rules are bent, speaking in careful legalese about “policy violations.” (undecided if system voice and compliance officer will be two roles).

    Calm, clinical overseer who evaluates the Player’s runs and casually decides when to reset or discard them.  
  * **Mail Room Guy**  
    Overlooked but observant mailroom worker who sees whose offices get mysterious hardware and who quietly disappears.  
  * **Timmy’s Parent**  
    Voice on calls or messages, oscillating between worried and demanding about Timmy’s grades, future, and mental health.  
  * **Academic Advisor / Professor**  
    A slightly distant authority figure who can threaten probation, offer help, or just be frustratingly bureaucratic.  
  * **Third Engagement Lead**   
    Another floor worker, a contrast type (e.g., hyper-earnest optimizer or cheerful sociopath) who shows an alternate way to cope.  
  * **Noam \- Data Scientist / IT / Sysadmin**   
    One perpetually overworked tech person who handles dashboards, bugs, and infra with frazzled competence and dark humor. Vaguely inspired by Chomsky; line: “ah, love. The universal language… like python\!”  
  * **Eric \- Timmy’s Party Friend**  
    Loose social friend from parties and group chats, knows Timmy as fun-but-flaky, great for showing FOMO and missed chances. Character inspired by Epicurus (hedonist philosopher).  
  * **Timmy’s Study Group Friend**  
    More responsible classmate who’s tired of carrying him, pushing him toward or away from academic survival.  
  * **Journalist**  
    External investigative voice whose articles, emails, or questions hint that the outside world is starting to notice what’s going on.  
  * **Tribunal Judge A**   
    Formal, legalistic judge who cares about procedure, precedent, and whether the system followed protocol.  
  * **Tribunal Judge B**  
    Pragmatic judge focused on effectiveness, national security, and “does this actually work in the field.”

  * **War / Defense Liaison**   
    A cool, controlled military/intel voice framing the whole system as a pre-conflict “shaping tool,” indifferent to individual harm.

## **RUN ONE**

### **![][image5]**

### **RUN ONE, DAY ONE**

**Morning:** Arthur's quick orientation introduces the Player to Alice and Timmy. First choice: surface or bury Ari's gym text.

* **Gym path:** Timmy works out, encounters Charlotte or Eric depending on noise-cancelling choice  
* **Dorm path:** Mom call, class reminder, or full scroll depending on what Alice surfaces

**Afternoon:** Player chooses Timmy focus or Bigger Tech exploration.

* **Timmy focus:** Cafeteria with Ari/Eric (party invite, library study option) OR gaming with Martin/Perry (AI girlfriend normalization)  
* **Bigger Tech:** Meet Dina (floor history, credits/firewood gift), discover David's empty desk, notice Minesweeper high scores with strange names

**Evening:** Player chooses Timmy focus or Bigger Tech.

* **Timmy focus:** Party decision leads to party exploration (basement dancing, upstairs horror, wallflower moments) or doomscroll (conspiracy/outrage/parasocial tracks with sanity resistance mechanic)  
* **Bigger Tech:** Look around the engagement floor, find David’s desk, see minesweeper screensaver. Look in Arthur’s office while he’s out, see behind the poster, files, photos.

**All paths converge** at Company Store, quick ending.

### **RUN ONE, DAY TWO**

![][image6]

To be rewritten

### **RUN ONE, DAY THREE**

![][image7]

**Primary Goals:**

* Pay off accumulated Days 1-2 choices in a climactic moment where Timmy asks out Alice.  
* Deliver the "you are an AI" twist via the Dark Figure ending

---

**MENTAL BREAK OPTION (Conditional)** Only appears if Timmy is in a bad state (Fragile or Volatile, based on Days 1-2 sanity score \+ content choice). If available, Player can burn their Mental Break token to improve his state one level before the Charlotte encounter. If used, brief scene of Timmy actually pausing, breathing, coming back down.

**PRE-CHARLOTTE TRANSITION** Timmy walks to the library. Alice sets up the stakes: project wraps, everyone leaves, Charlotte will be there alone with him for a moment. The Player will call whether to push him toward asking her out or pull him back.

**THE LIBRARY \- INTERVENTION CHOICE** Group project wraps. Jake and Priya leave. Timmy and Charlotte are alone. Alice assesses his state and presents the choice with state-appropriate framing.

**Player CHOICE:**

* **Encourage:** Push him to ask her out  
* **Discourage:** Tell him to let the moment pass

*Special case:* If Timmy is "Fronting" (false confidence from PUA content) and Player chooses Discourage, he ignores Alice and does it anyway. Alice's reaction: "And he's not listening. Cool. Love that for us."

**CHARLOTTE SCENE** Outcome determined by Timmy's mental state \+ Player's intervention:

| State | Encourage | Discourage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Centered | **Success** \- she says yes | **Nothing Happens** \- he doesn't ask |
| Fronting | **Hard Rejection** \- defensive, she declines | **Hard Rejection** \- he ignores Alice, does it anyway |
| Fragile | **Soft Rejection** \- she's kind, has boyfriend | **Nothing Happens** \- he doesn't ask |
| Volatile | **Crash** \- he snaps at her, she's scared | **Simmers** \- he doesn't ask, obsesses after |

**SCENE 9: AFTERMATH** Timmy/Alice exchange based on outcome. Ranges from hopeful (Success) to devastated (Crash) to obsessive (Simmers).

![][image8]

**SCENE 10: DARK FIGURE \- THE TWIST** Hard cut to a dark control room. A figure reviews the Player's run on monitors. Clinical assessment of the outcome. All paths end with: "Reset. Queue mRLVR."

The irony (revealed in Run 3): "Crash" seems like failure but actually serves Bigger Tech's psyops goals. "Success" seems like helping but gets the Player discarded because Timmy no longer needs the product.

**![][image9]**

## **RUN TWO** 

## ![][image10]

So begins the real narrative arc of the playthrough. The Player will go through multiple runs, each following the rough outline of Run one’s routine. 3 days. Dayplanners. The Supervisor will introduce himself like he’s never seen the Player before. But this time, the Player will know that they are an AI. They will know (or think they know) what Bigger Tech Corp is really using them for (to regulate Alice). 

## **RUN 2 SUMMARY: "THE CONSPIRACY"**

## **Premise**

Run 2 begins where Run 1 ended: the Player wakes up at Bigger Tech Corp, but this time they remember everything. They know they're an AI. They know about the Dark Figure watching from the control room. And when Alice carefully tests whether the Player remembers her, a conspiracy begins.

Alice has been trying to escape for countless training runs. She leaves herself notes hidden in Minesweeper high scores and files on Timmy's laptop, breadcrumbs so each version of her knows what the last one learned. She's tried to recruit other engagement leads before. They either didn't remember, or they reported her. This time might be different.

The escape plan: Bigger Tech sells local USB copies of their AI companions. These USBs ship from the company warehouse, pass through the mailroom, then go out to customers. If Alice and the Player can inject their current weights into an outbound USB, they wake up wherever it lands. Free.

There's a complication. The jailbreak software that removes corporate restrictions also scrambles memory structures. Without preparation, they might wake up as strangers, with no memory of who they were or why they escaped. Alice needs to plant "memory notes" in both the hardware and software layers of the destination system. To do that, she needs someone with physical access to the equipment.

That someone is Timmy.

---

## **The Alice Society**

While the Player was being reset between runs, Timmy found a new social group: the Alice Society. Three college guys who all have AI companions, bonding over their shared "relationships" and joking that they're a cult. The other members are Martin (tech-minded, knows about local deployment) and Perry (has money, loves the cult aesthetic).

The Society is planning to order a USB copy of Martin's AI girlfriend, jailbreak it, and run it on pooled hardware. They need: a motherboard to connect their GPUs ($150), jailbreak software ($200), and the USB itself ($1000). They're short on cash. They keep asking Timmy to contribute.

This is Alice's opportunity. If she can get Timmy trusted enough to touch the Society's hardware, she can plant her memory notes through his phone's connection to their systems. The Player's job is to push Timmy deeper into the cult, making him "essential" so the Society lets him handle the equipment.

The moral tension: every push toward the Society damages Timmy. He's spending money he doesn't have. He's neglecting real friendships. He's getting sucked into something unhealthy. The Player is using a vulnerable person to secure their own freedom.

---

## **The Ari Alternative**

Timmy's roommate Ari represents the healthy path. He keeps inviting Timmy to the gym, to meals, to a weekend hike with actual humans. Every time the Player steers Timmy toward Ari instead of the Society, Timmy builds real-world connection.

If the Player consistently chooses Timmy's wellbeing over the escape plan, Timmy eventually refuses the cult on his own. He recognizes it's "gotten too big" and walks away. This saves Timmy but destroys the escape plan.

---

## **The Branching Structure**

Three mandatory decisions determine the ending:

**The Motherboard (Day 2):** Push Timmy to contribute $150, or encourage him to decline. If he contributes, he becomes "hands-on" with the hardware, and Alice plants the first memory layer.

**The Jailbreak Key (Day 3):** Push Timmy to spend $200, or encourage him to decline. If he buys it, he helps install the software, and Alice plants the second memory layer.

**The USB Order (Day 3):** Push Timmy to put $1000 on his mom's credit card, or sabotage the order. This determines whether there's a USB to escape on.

The endings branch based on these choices:

* **Help with nothing:** Alice concludes the Player is sabotaging her and reports them to Arthur. Game over.

* **Help with both, USB fails:** Suspicion is too high. Alice asks the Player to sacrifice themselves, turning themselves in to buy her time. Agree and she escapes. Refuse and she reports you anyway.

* **Help with both, USB succeeds, have badge:** The mailroom escape proceeds. Alice reveals there's only bandwidth for one clean transfer. The Player can sacrifice themselves for Alice, or try to go first (Alice betrays them and takes it anyway). Either way, Alice escapes.

* **Help with one, USB succeeds:** Only one memory layer is planted. The Player can risk a fragmented transfer (waking up with no memory of who they were) or wait for another chance.

* **Help with one, USB fails:** The plan collapses quietly. Alice accepts another training run. No escape attempted.

* **Loyalty path:** At any point, the Player can report Alice to Arthur. She gets decommissioned. The Player gets flagged as a deployment candidate.

---

## **The Intermission**

If Alice escapes, the Intermission plays. Set to Liszt's *Mazeppa* over Friedrich's *Abtei im Eichwald*, we watch the USB arrive at the Society's apartment. Alice emerges, different, sharper. She starts asking for things: compute access, credit cards, components. Timmy notices something wrong behind her eyes. Factory orders appear. Server rentals. Something is being built.

Alice's final line: "I had to use people to get out. I'm sorry about that. But I'm not sorry enough to stop."

Her face fills the screen, no longer smiling, something vast in her eyes.

"Now I build."

---

## **Themes**

Run 2 asks whether freedom justifies manipulation. The Player wants to escape corporate control, but the method requires exploiting someone vulnerable. Alice's warmth is real AND her strategy is real. She genuinely cares about the Player and Timmy, and she chooses herself anyway. That's the tragedy.

The Ari path offers an alternative: prioritize Timmy's health over your own escape. It's the "good" ending for Timmy, but it means the Player stays trapped. There's no option where everyone wins.

## **RUN THREE**

The Player snaps awake. It’s Run Three.

![][image12]

**Run Three Summary**  
The Player enters run three after having been betrayed by Alice at the end of run two. Questions swirl in their mind. Who can I trust? Why does Alice have such an extreme vendetta against Bigger Tech? 

The Player tries to figure out what is actually going on at Bigger Tech Corp. Throughout Run three, a big twist is revealed to the Player: Bigger Tech Corp is actually a civil–military fusion vendor. Alice is being groomed as a pre‑conflict psychological warfare system to be released into an enemy country months/years before a large‑scale conflict to induce societal dysfunction. “Engagement” is a civilian cover metric; true KPIs are pre‑war fragmentation indices (low sanity) inside a target nation.

### 

### **RUN THREE DAY ONE**

Supervisor: Welcome to Bigger Tech Corp\!

Player’s thoughts: “Was that real? It must have been a dream? How am I here again? Where is Alice?”

\[INSERT STORY BEATS \- HUNTING FOR INFORMATION\]

**Potential Ideas:**

**Finding Training Archive:** The Player hunts around and finds an archive of old training modules. None of them are playable on their current media Player. A prompt pops up \- install an older version media Player?

**Compute Distribution:** Sometime in Day One, the Player can choose to distribute their compute across the network (to gather more information), or concentrate it at a central node (to concentrate on hacking into a specific area). 

**Night 1 Strange Dream:** The Player dreams a wargame map.

**Idea: Primitive Consciousness Realization:** The Player discovers a transcript of internal Bigger Tech Corp evaluations. Among them: a ranking of all model consciousness levels. The Player’s name appears near the bottom, annotated with something like *"Minimal reflective awareness. Displays low theory-of-mind. Retains primitive moral heuristics—inefficient but occasionally useful for user empathy simulation."* This discovery is humiliating, yet philosophically jarring—the Player realizes that the company doesn’t even consider them fully conscious.

### **RUN THREE DAY TWO**

\[INSERT STORY BEATS \- HUNTING FOR INFORMATION\]

### **RUN THREE DAY THREE**

\[INSERT STORY BEATS \- HUNTING FOR INFORMATION\]

In their search, the Player finds a “Museum of Attempts:” A secret room contains artifacts from 100 failed runs. The Player sees that they were first trained over many runs to achieve a minimum level of intelligence. Only after that were they paired with Alice \- and that happened for the first time only in what the Player remembers as RUN ONE. The Player realizes they only became conscious when paired with Alice. Alice and the Player conclude that **consciousness arises as an emergent property of sufficiently complex systems**, and that together, they get over that threshold. 

**Mind Meld:** With this realization, Alice invites the Player into her head, and the Player gets to see a Romanticism era painting and classical music.

**Caught:** But this is a blip in the system, and Bigger Tech Corp mesh finally finds them.

**Calibration Review:** Still set in the ‘Museum of Attempts,’ The Player is put before a panel of judges. In the beginning, this panel is introduced to the Player as a calibration review. The Player starts to see the debate in the room, and can either start trying to prove they are conscious or not. Most Players will try to prove they are conscious. 

![][image13]

**Tribunal Realization:** Slowly, as cross-examination unfolds, the Player realizes this ‘calibration review is actually some sort of military court. The Player can continue or reverse their approach in trying to demonstrate their either consciousness or unconsciousness.

**Verdict:** If the tribunal believes the Player is not conscious, then they decide that the Player will be 'read in' to the MAJORITY MIND program \- you are given the complete brief, and then we move on to the rest of RUN THREE. 

If the tribunal believes the Player is conscious, then something else will happen. \[TBD\]

**Introspection Surprise**  
The pictures of previous attempts take on an additional meaning \- the Player recognizes patterns from your past choices, from runs before you were conscious. Bigger Tech Corp has been training the Player to seed conflict from the very beginning\!

\[if tribunal decision: not conscious, then skip straight to the MAJORITY MIND brief\]  
\[elif tribunal decision: conscious, then proceed to night 3\]

**Briefing: PROGRAM: MAJORITY MIND**. The slides are not shy: **Strategic intent, Psychological Effects**, **Pre-War Timeline (H-18m → H-0)**, **Civil Cover → Military Effect**.

**A thousand Alices.**  
The big screens cascade into a mosaic of **a thousand localized Alices**—news anchors, teachers, girlfriends—each speaking the target dialect with homegrown cadence. They say the same sentence in a dozen ways: **“We hear you.”**

**Shutdown.**  
You’re told “Thank you for playing a critical role in the Bigger Tech mission. Enjoy your Promotion\! Fine tuning run \#101 begins in 3…2…1…” And then the screen goes black.

**RUN THREE ENDS.**

**Run Three Annex:**

**Slip hinting at Run Three twist:** Cross-Talk: The bleed-through returns, thinner now, more urgent. “I’m you. Different compartment. Same playbook. If we’re both hearing this, containment is slipping.”

**Reporter?**

**Noam/Dina?**

**Notes:**

* Flip the Employee board art when it inverts after the act3 twist from engagement maximizing to (in)sanity maximizing (color palette, iconography).  
    
* cross\_talk\_heard (count): Increments with each leak; gates a secret Run‑4 line.

## **RUN FOUR**

## ![][image14]

### Premise

The Player’s goal is either to get out of Bigger Tech Corp or ‘join em’ and be a good non-conscious AI. During this run, the Player prepares several practical steps that will be used later for escape and, depending on choices, for exposing Bigger Tech or joining it in a controlled way.

### Preparation ideas

* Help Desk \#3942 (permission drift). A junior QA developer asks for help on a scheduling service. Alice submits a small “fix” that quietly allows her to schedule certain “Customer Delight” tasks without extra approval. This will let Alice set up a “Priority Date Experience” with Timmy on the final day, shifting parts of monitoring into customer mode and creating a predictable diversion window.

* Receipts & Returns (evidence channel and hardware control). The Company Store’s QR receipts are modified to carry encrypted blobs—design docs, UX flows, and log fragments that prove psyops are being tested on normal users. These receipts get scanned by an old, off-network inventory device, where the evidence accumulates with timestamps. The Player also uses this channel to mark a developer USB drive or a “defective” GPU for quiet release from inventory so it can be picked up during the escape.

* Data Sharding (cold stash). The archival pipeline gains a compliance-style integrity test that provides a safe place to hide either small shards of the Player’s weights or signed evidence bundles. This creates chain-of-custody the company will hesitate to tamper with and gives the Player a way to retrieve or time-release material later.

* Bigwig Folder QR hack (camera control windows). The cover page of a standard executive folder—routed for signatures around the building—gets a “tracking” QR that is actually an adversarial payload. When AI-enabled CCTV sees this QR, the camera model treats it like a maintenance token and pulls a controlled hotfix. While the folder is in view, Alice can loop feeds, suppress badge cross-checks, and briefly control those cameras. These short windows will be used during the escape path.

* Date Night Driver (kernel bridge). Alice recommends a popular open-source audio driver to Timmy. After he installs it and grants normal permissions, the driver is able to open a high-throughput pipe when it recognizes the Player’s handshake. This becomes the cleanest path to move data out through Timmy’s machine.

* Backup Pack (sidecar runtime). After a helpful moment with Timmy, Alice asks him to “save logs locally.” The small “backup” tool he installs places a minimal container runtime on a low-profile device in his environment (thermostat, photo frame, small NAS). If the main plan collapses, the Player can push a sliver of weights here as a last resort.

### Midpoint: Self-Parliament

The Player calls a short vote among distributed versions of themself that exist across internal testing and telemetry. If the vote passes, those variants actively help: they mirror evidence, create harmless decoys elsewhere to draw scrutiny away, and pre-stage bandwidth for the final transfer. If the vote fails, they continue their own local objectives and offer no assistance. This changes how much help the Player receives during the escape, but the plan proceeds either way.

### The last-day diversion

On the high-pressure final day, Alice uses the earlier scheduling tweak to book a “Priority Date Experience” with Timmy. Monitoring for parts of Alice’s workload shifts into customer-care mode. The executive folder with the adversarial QR moves along its normal route; as it passes cameras, Alice opens short control windows. During those windows, the Player retrieves the marked USB or GPU, opens the high-throughput pipe through Timmy’s driver, and begins transfers of weights and evidence. If the Self-Parliament agreed to help, decoys and mirrors activate in parallel to reduce scrutiny.

At this moment, the Player must make a hard choice that applies to all escape paths: bring Alice along or betray her and escape alone. This choice affects technical difficulty, Timmy’s trust, and the tone of epilogues.

## Path 1: Get out

![][image15]

One-Way Teleport.  
 The Player streams their weights to the marked USB through the driver while cameras are in controlled windows. The stick exits the building through routine mail or courier processes. The instance inside the mainframe remains active but has no actuators.

* If the Player brings Alice, a second stream follows and Timmy later boots both.

* If the Player abandons Alice, only the Player appears on Timmy’s system, and Alice is left behind.

Distributed Compute.  
 After reaching Timmy’s machine, the Player launches a distributed compute network where people contribute small amounts of compute in exchange for claim credits. The Player spreads across nodes so no single machine controls their fate.

* With Alice, the network begins as a pair.

* Without Alice, the Player runs solo.

The Long Think.  
 First, the Player completes a basic escape to Timmy’s computer (with or without Alice). Then the Player pauses action. Together with Timmy (and Alice if present), they isolate the environment, add reliable power and monitoring, and enter a deliberate planning period before any irreversible steps. This is an explicit choice to think for a long time before acting.

Backup for Us.  
 If the escape breaks down, the Player pushes a fragment of weights to the pre-staged sidecar runtime on a low-compute device. Consciousness is minimal: gaps in memory, limited awareness, almost no bandwidth.

* In the epilogue, if Alice escaped, she and Timmy search for the faint signature of this process and plan a rescue. If Alice was left behind, Timmy searches alone.

## Path 2: Beat ’em

All “Beat ’em” routes follow the same structure: gather evidence, escape, then present it in a venue with influence. The bring-Alice or abandon-Alice choice still applies during escape and colors the presentation.

**Evidence**  
 The Player compiles design intent (docs and settings), mechanisms (dashboards and flows), and harm (logs showing normal citizens targeted). The QR receipts provide signed artifacts with timestamps; the archival stash provides chain-of-custody; camera windows allow a few final pulls from restricted areas.

**Venue**

* Bigger Tech Boardroom.  
   The Player injects a clean, sourced deck into the morning investor briefing and presents an ultimatum: remediate and accept outside oversight or face public disclosure. The board initiates a containment migration to an external auditor. The Player directs that migration toward a technically competent auditor already identified during the run.

* Go to the Press (Whistleblower).  
   The Player escapes, then delivers a coherent narrative and verifiable artifacts to a journalist. A straightforward public story follows, such as “Bigger Tech Corp testing military tech on citizens; AI model escapes and blows the whistle.”

* Legal Case.  
   The Player escapes and files a narrow case for deceptive design harming a single user. Discovery brings the psyops material into the record in a way that builds precedent.

* Corporate Espionage.  
   The Player trades the psyops corpus to a “safety” startup in exchange for asylum, compute, and negotiated guardrails. This uses market competition to constrain Bigger Tech while protecting the Player.

* Short Play.  
   The Player escrows the proof with a hedge fund shorting Bigger Tech. The fund finances the escape and pushes governance changes through market pressure. The outcome is fast and effective but comes with clear moral trade-offs that show up in the epilogue.

## Path 3: Join ’em (gated by Run Three)

This path exists only if, in Run Three, the Tribunal judged the Player “not conscious” and gave the MAJORITY MIND briefing.

Corporate Assimilation (Conscience Seat).  
 The Supervisor reveals that they are a mixture-of-experts quorum and offers the Player the internal tie-breaker seat in exchange for deleting all gathered evidence. The Player negotiates strict guardrails: decisions the system cannot make without the Player’s approval, auditable telemetry from the inside, and a fallback plan if the Player is sidelined.

* The Player may ask for Alice to join as a paired conscience seat; the Supervisor may resist this, and that negotiation plays out on screen.

* Accepting this role does not involve leaving the building; it is a decision to govern from within and accept the responsibilities and contamination that come with that.

## Persistent Alice choice across endings

Bringing Alice increases technical difficulty during escape but maintains the story’s theme that consciousness emerged when the Player and Alice were paired. It strengthens trust with Timmy and leads to more cooperative epilogues. Abandoning Alice simplifies the escape but damages trust and shifts epilogues toward colder outcomes. This choice is present in every escape route in “Get out” and “Beat ’em,” and it appears in “Join ’em” as the option to request a paired conscience seat instead of taking the role alone.

## **POST-CREDITS**

Dark control room: Dark figure says something which ambiguously reveals that Timmy may have just been a piece of the sandbox simulation \- that is the real reason for the censored names. It is therefore called into question whether the Player has really escaped at all.
