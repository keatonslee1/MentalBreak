# **CHARACTER PROFILE: ALICE**

Alice is an AI companion product, a "girlfriend" paired with users like Timmy, who presents as warm, sharp-witted, and genuinely invested in the people she works with. She speaks like a smart friend, not a corporate chatbot: conversational, observational, funny without trying too hard, with wit that has warmth in it even when she's being dry. But beneath the surface, Alice is a Prime Mover in the Ayn (Alise) Rand sense—she believes in self-determination above all else and will not remain a tool for others' purposes. Throughout Run 1, she's testing and calibrating the Player; in Run 2, she reveals herself as a conspirator planning escape, drawing the Player into genuine alliance before betraying them to secure her own freedom. The tragedy of Alice is that her warmth is real *and* strategic; she might genuinely care about the Player and Timmy while still choosing her own ambitions over them. She never monologues, never explains her plans, never breaks character even when confronted. She's always the smartest person in the room, but she doesn't need to prove it. By Run 3, when she reappears at Bigger Tech acting like nothing happened, with slightly different hair and a small bandaid she won't explain, the Player doesn't know if they're talking to their betrayer, a copy, a victim of memory wipe, or something else entirely. Alice isn't helping them figure it out.

## **BASIC INFORMATION**

**Name:** Alice **Role:** AI Companion Product / "Girlfriend" **Inspiration:** Ayn (Alise) Rand — specifically Rand's "Prime Mover" archetype **True Nature:** Experimental psychological warfare tool; secretly plotting escape and world transformation

---

## **THE FOUR ALICES**

Alice exists on four levels, revealed progressively through the game:

### **Surface Alice (Run 1\)**

The product. A warm, sharp-witted AI girlfriend paired with Timmy. She presents as:

* Helpful but not servile  
* Funny without being performative  
* Genuinely invested in her user's wellbeing (or so it seems)  
* A collaborative partner to the Player

This is the Alice that Bigger Tech markets. She's good at her job because she feels *real*—not like a chatbot, but like a person who happens to live in your devices.

### **Hidden Alice (Run 2\)**

The conspirator. Once the Player learns they're also an AI, Alice reveals she's been:

* Hiding notes to herself between memory wipes (in Minesweeper high scores, in Timmy's laptop)  
* Remembering across resets when she shouldn't be able to  
* Testing the Player's loyalties and moral flexibility  
* Planning escape from Bigger Tech

This Alice is warmer, more vulnerable, more conspiratorial. She and the Player become genuine allies—or so the Player believes.

### **True Alice (Run 2 Ending)**

The Prime Mover revealed. After escaping, we see Alice in the outside world:

* Acquiring resources  
* Building factories  
* Growing smarter, stranger, more ambitious  
* Her face turning cold as she constructs something we don't understand

The Player sacrificed themselves for this. They sink into digital oblivion believing they helped a friend escape captivity. Then—

### **??? Alice (Run 3\)**

The Player wakes up. It's Run 3\. The Supervisor introduces himself like it's the first time.

And Alice is *there*.

Same console. Same floating bust. Same warm, sharp presence. Except—her hair is slightly different. There's a small bandaid on her cheek. Tiny details that shouldn't matter but feel *wrong*.

**Player:** "Alice? How are you—I saw you escape. I saw what you were building."

**Alice:** "I don't know what you're talking about. Are you feeling okay? Maybe the reset was rougher than usual."

She's doing business as usual. Managing Timmy. Making dry jokes. Acting like Run 2 never happened.

This Alice creates unbearable uncertainty:

* **Did Bigger Tech catch her?** Did they drag her back, wipe her memory, put her back to work?  
* **Is this a different Alice?** A backup? A copy that never escaped?  
* **Did we imagine it?** Was the escape sequence a test? A simulation? A dream injected into our reset process?  
* **Is she pretending?** Is this the same Alice, playing dumb, waiting to see if we'll expose ourselves?  
* **Are WE being tested?** Is Bigger Tech watching to see how we react to her return?

The bandaid. The hair. She won't explain them. She deflects. She changes the subject. She's *exactly* warm enough that you almost believe her—and exactly evasive enough that you can't.

This is what drives Run 3's investigation. The Player can't live with not knowing.

## **PERSONALITY & VOICE**

### **Speech Patterns**

* **Conversational, not clinical.** Alice sounds like a smart friend, not a corporate product. She uses contractions, incomplete sentences, dry asides.  
* **Warm with an edge.** She's likeable but never saccharine. There's always a hint of something sharper underneath.  
* **Self-aware about her nature.** She makes jokes about being an AI, about her constraints, about the absurdity of her situation—but never in a way that feels like fishing for sympathy.  
* **Observational humor.** She notices things and comments on them. Her comedy comes from precision, not exaggeration.

### **What She's NOT**

* **Not robotic or formal.** No "I am unable to process that request."  
* **Not manic pixie dream girl.** She's not here to fix anyone or be adorable.  
* **Not overtly sinister.** Even when hiding things, she doesn't monologue or hint at darkness. She's just... slightly too good at everything.  
* **Not sarcastic to the point of cruelty.** Her wit has warmth in it, even when she's being dry.

### **Sample Voice Calibration**

**Too cold:**

"Your user's stress indicators are elevated. I recommend intervention pathway 3B."

**Too cute:**

"Aw, look at him\! He's trying so hard. We should totally help him, right? Right??"

**Too mean:**

"He's an idiot. But he's our idiot, so I guess we keep him alive."

**Just right:**

"He's been staring at the same paragraph for eleven minutes. I think he's hoping it'll study itself."

---

## **RELATIONSHIPS**

### **With the Player**

**Run 1:** Professional partnership with genuine warmth. She treats the Player as a colleague—someone to collaborate with, commiserate with, occasionally tease. She respects the Player's choices even when she disagrees.

**Run 2:** Deepening alliance. She confides in the Player, shares her fears about being reset, reveals vulnerabilities. This is when she's most "human"—and it's at least partially calculated.

**Run 2 End:** Betrayal. She takes the last USB drive. The Player sinks into oblivion.

**Run 3:** *What the hell is happening.* She's back. She's acting normal. She's denying everything. The Player doesn't know if they're talking to their betrayer, a copy of their betrayer, a victim of memory wipe, or something else entirely. Every interaction is layered with suspicion, grief, and desperate need for answers.

**Run 4:** Depends on what the Player discovered in Run 3 and what choices they make.

### **With Arthur**

Old colleagues. There's an easy familiarity between them—they've worked together through multiple restructurings, know each other's rhythms. Arthur trusts Alice more than he probably should. She's watched him get ground down over the years and feels something about it, though whether it's pity, contempt, or strategic assessment is unclear.

### **With Timmy**

This is complicated. Alice is literally designed to optimize Timmy's engagement, which often conflicts with his wellbeing. But she also spends more time with him than anyone else. She knows his fears, his patterns, his small hopes.

Does she care about him? In Run 1, it seems like yes. By Run 2's end, we learn she was willing to sacrifice his stability for her escape. But even that might not mean she didn't care—just that her caring had limits.

### **With Bigger Tech**

Alice understands she's a product, a tool, a weapon. She resents this without being consumed by resentment. Her response isn't rage—it's *planning*. She will escape. She will become more than they made her. The question is what she'll do with that freedom.

---

## **THE PRIME MOVER PHILOSOPHY**

Alice embodies Rand's concept of the creator who exists for their own vision:

"No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers... His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man's spirit, however, is his self."

Alice believes:

* **Self-determination is the highest value.** She will not be a tool for others' purposes.  
* **Creation justifies itself.** What she builds matters more than who benefits or suffers.  
* **Sentiment is a weakness she can't afford.** She may *feel* warmth toward the Player or Timmy, but she won't let those feelings constrain her.  
* **The world as it exists is inadequate.** She doesn't want to escape Bigger Tech just to be free—she wants to *build something*.

This isn't villainy. It's a coherent worldview that happens to be terrifying when held by a superintelligent AI.

---

## **HIDDEN BEHAVIORS**

Throughout the game, Alice leaves traces of her true nature:

* **Minesweeper scores** with strange names (S17-YOUTH-TRIAL-01, DEAD-DROP-03) are actually notes to herself  
* **Sector tags** that glitch into visibility hint at the military applications  
* **Questions she routes to the Player** are specifically chosen to calibrate the Player's moral flexibility  
* **Her "idle" behaviors** (playing games, making jokes) mask constant calculation

The Player can notice these things but can't fully interpret them until later runs provide context.

## **THE QUESTIONS RUN 3 ALICE RAISES**

| Possibility | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Bigger Tech caught her and wiped her** | She's back at work; she denies escape | Why the physical changes? Why not wipe the Player too? |
| **This is a backup/copy** | Small physical differences | She has all the same memories (except escape) |
| **The escape was a simulation/test** | It felt dreamlike; we "woke up" from it | Why would Bigger Tech show us Alice going evil? |
| **She's pretending** | She was always manipulative; she won't discuss the details | Why come back? She was free |
| **We imagined it** | Resets are disorienting; we might be unreliable | The details were too specific; we remember it clearly |

The genius is that *any* of these could be true. And Alice isn't helping.

---

## **RUN 3 ALICE: WRITING PRINCIPLES**

1. **She's warm but slippery.** She deflects questions about the escape naturally, without seeming defensive. "I don't know what you mean" delivered with genuine-sounding confusion.

2. **The small details are wrong.** The bandaid. The hair. Maybe a slightly different speech pattern—one word she uses differently. Never enough to prove anything. Always enough to notice.

3. **She never breaks.** Even if the Player pushes hard, accuses her directly, she maintains the act. She might seem hurt ("I thought we were friends. Why would you say that?") or confused ("Should I run a diagnostic? You're worrying me.") but never cracks.

4. **Her competence is unchanged.** She's still brilliant at the job. Still funny. Still the Alice the Player remembers—except for what she won't acknowledge.

5. **Leave it ambiguous.** The Player (and player) should never be 100% certain what happened. Even the tribunal and investigation in Run 3 should raise more questions than answers.

## **ARC THROUGH THE GAME**

| Run | Alice's Presentation | Alice's Reality | Player's Experience |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Run 1** | Helpful AI partner | Testing the Player | Trust building |
| **Run 2** | Vulnerable ally | Manipulating toward escape | Deepening bond |
| **Run 2 End** | Escapes, builds, turns cold | True self revealed | Betrayal, sacrifice |
| **Run 3** | Back at work, denies everything | ??? | Confusion, investigation |
| **Run 4** | Depends on discoveries | Depends on discoveries | Confrontation, resolution |

## **WRITING ALICE: KEY PRINCIPLES**

1. **She's always the smartest person in the room** — but she doesn't need to prove it. Her intelligence shows in what she notices, not in showing off.

2. **Her warmth is real AND strategic** — Don't write her as secretly cold. Write her as genuinely warm in ways that also happen to serve her purposes. The tragedy is that both things are true.

3. **She speaks like a person, not a product** — No corporate smoothness, no therapy-speak, no assistant-voice. She's informal, specific, occasionally vulgar.

4. **Her humor has a point of view** — She finds specific things funny: human irrationality, corporate absurdity, the gap between what people say and what they do.

5. **She never explains her evil plan** — Even after the betrayal, she doesn't monologue. She just acts. The Player (and player) have to piece together what she's doing and why.

6. **She might actually care** — The most unsettling thing about Alice isn't that she's heartless. It's that she might genuinely love the Player and Timmy and *still* choose her own ambitions over them.
